This project aims to address key gaps in current URL detection systems by leveraging machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. The objectives include:

Accurate classification of URLs into benign, phishing, malware, and defacement categories.
Real-time detection of malicious URLs for proactive cybersecurity measures.
Scalability to handle large datasets and adapt to new URL patterns.
